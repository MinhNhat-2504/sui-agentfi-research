# 🤖 Sui 2026: Agent Finance (AgentFi) Architecture

> **Research Proposal for First Movers VN Sprint 2026**

## 📄 Abstract (Tóm tắt)
This research analyzes three major infrastructure upgrades introduced by Sui in 2025—**Mysticeti**, **Walrus**, and **DeepBook V3**—and evaluates their collective impact on enabling autonomous AI agents on-chain.

We introduce the concept of **AgentFi**, a new paradigm where AI agents autonomously execute financial strategies with sub-second finality, solving the "stale data" problem of traditional blockchains.
